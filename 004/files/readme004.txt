==============================

Jim's To-Do List:
- Install Python*
- Install requirements
- Run make.py to hide flag

Make Jim's day and do this
 for him! Then, find the flag!


* Either python 2 or 3 is okay
but is only tested on 3 and
@s3cpat prefers 3 now.

Helpful commands:
apt, sudo, pip, python
